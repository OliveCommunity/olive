# Policy: VENDORED OpenColorIO, statically linked, everywhere it builds.
# The [patch.crates-io] ocio-sys tracks shaloong/ocio-rs main, whose
# vendored yaml-cpp carries the <cstdint> include the 0.2.1 crate is
# missing (without it the vendored build fails on GCC >= 16).
# Windows/MinGW is the exception: the vendored OCIO source needs
# MSVC-only constructs, so the MSYS2 system package is used instead —
# statically when it ships libOpenColorIO.a, dynamically otherwise (the
# CD packaging then bundles the DLL next to the binaries).
#
# Pre-set OCIO_RS_LINK / OCIO_INSTALL_DIR are honored, never clobbered.
