# Installs the system dependencies of the Oak Rust workspace:
# the free-license external codec/filter libraries FFmpeg is configured
# with (see crates/oak-codec/Cargo.toml), plus the build tools. FFmpeg
# itself is built from source by tooling/ffmpeg/build-ffmpeg.sh (which
# installs into .cache/ffmpeg) and is NOT installed here.
#
# Supported: Homebrew (macOS), MSYS2 UCRT64 (Windows), Debian/Ubuntu,
# Fedora, Arch. Run it yourself — nothing in the build invokes it
# automatically (it needs sudo on Linux).
#
# Usage: tooling/install-deps.sh
