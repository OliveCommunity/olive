/**
 * @brief Functions for converting HTML to QTextDocument and vice versa
 *
 * Qt does contain its own functions for this, however they have some limitations. Some things that
 * we want to support (e.g. kerning/spacing and font stretch) are not implemented in Qt's
 * QTextHtmlExporter and QTextHtmlParser. Additionally, since these functions are not part of Qt's
 * public API, and make many references to other parts of Qt that are not part of the public API,
 * there is no way to subclass or extend their functionality without forking Qt as a whole.
 *
 * Therefore, it became necessary to write a custom class for the conversion so that we can
 * ensure support for the features we need.
 *
 * If someone wishes to extend this class for more feature support, feel free to open a pull
 * request. But this is NOT intended to be an exhaustive HTML implementation, and is primarily
 * designed to store rich text in a standard format for the purpose of text formatting for video.
