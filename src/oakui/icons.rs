//! Theme-aware toolbar icons.
//!
//! The toolbar/transport icons are the PNGs pulled from the legacy C++ app
//! (`app/ui/style/olive-{dark,light}/png` in the pre-Rust history), stored in
//! `assets/icons/{dark,light}/`. Each theme ships its own glyph color (white
//! on dark, black on light), so the active [`OakTheme`] picks the family.
//!
//! Icons render on a 16px logical grid from the 32px (2×) files; buttons give
//! them a 24px hit target and a localized tooltip.
//!
//! [`OakTheme`]: gpui_widgets::theme::OakTheme
