//! `oakapp` — the Rust application layer of Oak, built on the `gpui` UI
//! framework (the oak-gpui fork at `gpui/`).
//!
//! This is the start of the Rust rewrite of `app/` (Qt): a gpui window with
//! the main layout from the design (`design/`), dockable panels built from
//! the `gpui_widgets` library, and an engine seam (`oakui`) with two
//! backends: the mock ([`oakui::MockEngine`]) feeding demo data, and the
//! real engine ([`oakui::RealEngine`]) driving the oak* module crates
//! directly (M14 R3: project open/save through the oaknode serializer,
//! timeline edits through the oaktimeline edit commands on the oakundo
//! global stack, the oakrender ticket arena for the viewers, the oaktask
//! export path, the oakcommon config store, and the oakstorage
//! write-through library — no `liboakengine` dylib, no C ABI).
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! * [`app`] — the window shell: menu bar, dock layout, status bar, modal
//!   dialogs (file open/save-as, preferences, export), tick loop.
//! * [`dialogs`] — the preferences and export dialog content views.
//! * [`actions`] — the action registry: gpui actions, stable ids, default
//!   keys and routing (the single source behind the menus and shortcuts).
//! * [`manager`] — the project manager window (M13 D4): the library browser
//!   with new / open / rename / duplicate / delete / import / export.
//! * [`menus`] — the right-click menu layer: shared segments built from the
//!   action registry and the per-panel context-menu plumbing.
//! * [`panels`] — the dockable panels (viewers, timeline, inspector, ...).
//! * [`oakui`] — the engine gateway trait, the mock + real implementations,
//!   and the pure view-state logic (timecode, transport).
//!
//! # Running
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --bin oak-editor                        # the real engine, no project
//! cargo run --bin oak-editor -- path/to/project.ove    # open a project at startup
//! cargo run --bin oak-editor -- --mock              # the demo (mock) engine
//! cargo test                                         # unit tests (app + crates)
//! ```
//!
//! The engine backend is selected at startup: the real engine by default,
//! the mock with the `--mock` flag, `OAK_ENGINE=mock`, or the
//! `mock-engine` cargo feature.
