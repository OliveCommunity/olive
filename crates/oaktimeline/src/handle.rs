//! Refcounted-handle scaffolding for the oakengine facade boundary.
//!
//! After the single-lib unification the crate's internal object
//! references are plain Rust types: the timeline commands hold
//! [`Arc<Mutex<…>>`] handles to the shared marker list / work area, and
//! [`CHandle`] appears only in the facade-facing entries that the
//! oakengine C ABI export layer (and the first-party frontends) call.
//!
//! Every [`make_owned`] value handle boxes an [`Arc<Mutex<T>>`] behind a
//! [`RefBox`] (the same pattern as the oaknode project handles): the
//! facade reads the shared object back through
//! `get::<Arc<Mutex<T>>>`, clones the `Arc`, and the command entries do
//! the same when they convert a handle into the crate's Rust-typed
//! command constructors. The box's addref/release functions only manage
//! the handle shell — the `Arc` keeps the actual value alive.
