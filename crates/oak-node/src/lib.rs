//! # oaknode — the node graph engine (Rust)
//!
//! Reimplements the C++ oaknode module behind its frozen C ABI
//! (`include/node/*.h`). See README.md for the architectural mapping
//! (inheritance → arena + trait objects, etc.).
//!
//! ## Handle discipline
//!
//! Post-single-lib, this crate has no C exports: module-to-module calls
//! are plain Rust types, and object references never travel through
//! handles. The remaining `CHandle`s are (a) the facade-facing handle
//! scaffolding in [`handle`] (oakengine/oakstorage box `Project` /
//! `NodeRef` behind it) and (b) opaque cross-module payloads the crate
//! cannot name as Rust types — oakrender textures/frames/caches and
//! oaktimeline markers/work areas, whose owning crates depend on
//! oaknode. Shared state lives behind `Mutex`.
