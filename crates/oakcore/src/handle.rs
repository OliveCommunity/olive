//! The shared ABI value-handle type (single-lib unification).
//!
//! Every module crate used to define its own `CHandle` with an identical
//! `{ctx, addref, release, abi_version}` layout but a distinct Rust type,
//! so cross-module calls had to cross an `extern "C"`/dlsym boundary.
//! With the module-to-module calls going back to direct Rust calls (see
//! `docs/zh/plans/riir/single-lib.md`), one canonical handle type lives
//! here in `oakcore-rs` (the crate every module already depends on) and
//! every crate re-exports it. The C layout is unchanged, so the frozen
//! module C ABIs (`Oak<Mod><Type>*` handles in `include/<mod>/*.h`) are
//! unaffected.
