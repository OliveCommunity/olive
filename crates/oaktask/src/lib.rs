//! # oaktask — the task execution module (Rust)
//!
//! Reimplements the C++ task module (`src/task/src`) as direct Rust
//! (single-lib unification): inheritance → one module per class + trait
//! objects, cancellation via `oakcommon::cancelatom::CancelAtom`, events
//! as boxed callbacks. All node-graph, timeline and render work goes
//! through the direct `oaknode` / `oakrender` Rust APIs
//! ([`nodeops`] holds the graph operations the tasks share).
