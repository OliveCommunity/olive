//! The `TaskManager` singleton, mirroring `src/task/src/taskmanager.h`.
//!
//! Holds the set of live [`crate::task::Task`] instances; starting a task
//! hands its ownership to the manager, which also exposes the codec task
//! submitter registration (see [`crate::codecbridge`]).
//!
//! CPP-PARITY: src/task/src/taskmanager.h
//!
//! ## Threading model
//!
//! [`TaskManager::add_task`] spawns a worker thread that runs the task's
//! [`Task::start`]. The worker thread only touches the task (through a raw
//! pointer) and never the manager, so the manager's own mutex is never held
//! across a join in the C ABI paths (joins happen lock-free via
//! [`TaskManager::drain_finished`] / [`TaskManager::take_thread_by_ptr`]).
