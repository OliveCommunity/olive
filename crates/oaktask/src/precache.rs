//! `PreCacheTask`, mirroring `src/task/src/precache/precachetask.h`.
//!
//! Renders a footage node through [`crate::render::RenderTask`] to fill
//! the playback cache. The footage and its sequence are now
//! [`crate::nodeops::NodeRef`] domain references (the deleted oaknode C
//! ABI stubs are gone); video params come from the sequence's parameter
//! streams and the cache range is the full footage video length.
//!
//! **Simplifications over the C++**: the deep project copy / viewer
//! wiring is not built (the render drives the given footage directly —
//! the ticket carries the footage filename and the footage node's
//! identity as the cache key) and the timeline work-area intersection is
//! replaced by the full footage length. The direct ticket arena's eval
//! producer does not persist frames to the frame cache yet, so this
//! render pass warms nothing on disk; the plumbing is in place.
