//! # oakcodec — the media codec module (Rust)
//!
//! Reimplements the C++ oakcodec module behind its frozen C ABI
//! (`include/codec/*.h`). See README.md for the architectural mapping
//! (inheritance → traits, shared_ptr → refcounted handles, etc.).
//!
//! ## FFI discipline
//!
//! Identical to the oaknode/oakplugin crates: every export goes through
//! [`handle::guard*`], handles are opaque refcounted boxes, shared
//! state behind `Mutex`.
