//! Render-worker IPC shim (M15 S1): the NDJSON protocol and the
//! shared-memory frame-slot transport now live in the oakrender crate
//! (`oakrender::ipc`) so both ends of the pipe link one copy — the
//! main-process dispatcher creates the segments and the worker attaches
//! to them. This module re-exports the whole surface, keeping the
//! worker-side `crate::ipc::` paths unchanged. The facade (oakengine)
//! still keeps its own copy for the frozen `oakengine_ipc_*` C ABI.
