//! Split commands (`src/timeline/src/timelineundosplit.h`). Graph
//! operations go directly through the oaknode Rust domain (the oaknode
//! C ABI was deleted in the single-lib unification).
//!
//! The C++ oracles (`timelineundosplit.cpp`) clone the split block in the
//! project graph (`oaknode_node_copy_in_graph` + `oaknode_block_from_node`),
//! run a captured node-graph reconnect command, preserve link groups
//! (`oaknode_block_are_linked`), move out-transitions across the split
//! (`oaknode_node_disconnect`/`oaknode_node_connect`), and add cache
//! passthrough (`oaknode_clip_add_cache_passthrough_from`). The clone is
//! restored via `NodeBehavior::duplicate` (the Rust equivalent of
//! `Node::Copy`) and link preservation via `Graph::link`; the
//! transition/cache/reconnect steps have no Rust equivalent yet and are
//! noted at each site.
