# Olive Video Editor Community Edition[![Build status](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

Olive is a free non-linear video editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Unfortunately, the original author has not submitted code updates for over 7 months, and no public contact information (email or otherwise) is available to reach them directly.

Now, we are maintaining a community edition for this project.
